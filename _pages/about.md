## About Me

I'm a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at the **University of Salerno** (Italy), supervised by [Gennaro Costagliola](https://docenti.unisa.it/004178/en/home) and [Mattia De Rosa](https://docenti.unisa.it/051676/en/home). I’m a member of the Computer Languages and User-Experience (CLUE) Lab, where my research focuses on:

- The application of **Machine Learning techniques to compilers**
- The use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for **program translation**
- **Computer Science Education**, with a particular interest in how intelligent systems can support learning and teaching programming

Additionally, I work for the Italian Ministry of Education as a computer science teacher for high school students. Moreover, my background includes Full-Stack Development experience spanning from 2013 to 2022.
