I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Salerno (Italy). I am a member of the Computer Languages and User-Experience Lab, where I conduct research on Machine Learning approaches applied to compilers, Multidimensional Languages, and Human-Computer Interaction.

Additionally, I work for the Italian Ministry of Education as a computer science teacher for high school students. Moreover, my background includes Full-Stack Development experience spanning from 2013 to 2022.
